## Work Experience

**Data Scientist @ Picsart | User Behaviour (_Jan 2022 - Present_)**
- Delivered to production a crash anomaly detection model for the engineering
department to monitor and track the anomalous crash activity of users' mobile
devices.
- Researched and adapted alternative hypothesis testing approaches (implemented Sequential Testing for Interleaving)
to accelerate the company's data-driven decision-making processes.
- A/B testing and Interleaving, hypothesis testing. Communicated findings to both technical and non-technical
stakeholders, effectively translating complex analyses into actionable business insights.
- Conducted training for the AI department on leveraging the company's data and
promoted one of the main Data Flywheel initiatives among ML Scientists.
- Handled large datasets using PySpark and SQL via Databricks and AWS S3, applied
advanced statistical techniques to real-time decision systems, and performed visual
dataset analyses leveraging clustering ML algorithms and NN.
- Engaged in research-oriented tasks to inform product and operational decisions.

**Researcher @ FAST ADVANCE Research Grant Program | Explainable AI (_Mar 2023 - Present_)**
- Actively participating in a research project focused on developing interpretable,
robust machine learning models using Dempster-Shafer theory.
- Designing, implementing, and applying proposed explainable models in real-world datasets across
various sectors, and participating in preparing scientific articles for high-impact conferences and journals.

**Teaching Associate @ American University of Armenia | DS120 Programming for Data Science (_Jan 2022 - Jun 2022_)**
- Conducted problem-solving sessions.
- Graded homework.
- This role enhanced my ability to communicate complex ideas simply.

**Database Developer @ Synergy International Systems | Judiciary Systems (_Sep 2019 - Dec 2021_)**
- Worked on the database level of various judicial management systems of different
quickly evolving countries using.
